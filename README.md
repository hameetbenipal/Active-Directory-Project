# Active Directory/ Red Team and Blue Team Simulation

## Objective

The Active Directory project aimed to strengthen my knowledge of general IT concepts, as well as gain hands-on experience with a simulated attack and Blue Team/Red Team scenarios. This lab includes setting up an Active Directory enviroment and learning about IT administration and domains. Additonally, a SIEM will be utilized to ingest telemetry and logs in order to set up alerts from harmful actors. Overall, this lab provided me with hands-on experience with muliple facets of security and various evironments that occur in real life scenarios. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of Active Directory and domains.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Splunk (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Windows Active Directory to create domain.
- Telemetry generation tools (Sysmon) to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- AtomicRedTeam to simulate various attacks and test harmful scenarios.
